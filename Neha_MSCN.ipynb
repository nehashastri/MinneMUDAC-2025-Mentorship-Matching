And thank you for arranging the match closing; I know it's not ideal. Please see my answers below -- What were the highlights of your match? Meeting a smart, funny young person! Any regrets or disappointments in your match? No! What are your expectations for contact after the match is closed? Will you continue contact through phone, email, etc? As a reminder, once your match is closed all future contact is no longer under the supervision of mentor Brothers mentor Sisters. I don't know. I am open to further contact, though. Do you have any concerns with your child participating in a new match? No! Overall, I had a good experience with my child and enjoyed being a mentor. The only piece of feedback that I really have for the experience is that I wish the mentors would have received a bit more training. For example, how to deal with adolescents and the different situations they are in with their friends, how to form relationships with the child's family, etc. Thanks again Mai! With warm regards, mentor team emailed the following back: Hi mentor, Thanks for completing the closing and for the feedback! I will contact child and Germaine to do closing as well. I wish you well as you begin your motherhood journey. Thanks for all that you have done for child and the team program.\",\n          \" Activities:team asked about activities. mentor said they went to missing in action.

And thank you for arranging the match closing; I know it's not ideal. Please see my answers below -- What were the highlights of your match? Meeting a smart, funny young person! Any regrets or disappointments in your match? No! What are your expectations for contact after the match is closed? Will you continue contact through phone, email, etc? As a reminder, once your match is closed all future contact is no longer under the supervision of mentor Brothers mentor Sisters. I don't know. I am open to further contact, though. Do you have any concerns with your child participating in a new match? No! Overall, I had a good experience with my child and enjoyed being a mentor. The only piece of feedback that I really have for the experience is that I wish the mentors would have received a bit more training. For example, how to deal with adolescents and the different situations they are in with their friends, how to form relationships with the child's family, etc. Thanks again Mai! With warm regards, mentor team emailed the following back Hi mentor, Thanks for completing the closing and for the feedback! I will contact child and Germaine to do closing as well. I wish you well as you begin your motherhood journey. Thanks for all that you have done for child and the team program.\",\n          \"mentor said they went to missing in action.

Any regrets or disappointments in your match? No! What are your expectations for contact after the match is closed? Will you continue contact through phone, email, etc? As a reminder, once your match is closed all future contact is no longer under the supervision of mentor Brothers mentor Sisters. I don't know. I am open to further contact, though. Do you have any concerns with your child participating in a new match? No! Overall, I had a good experience with my child and enjoyed being a mentor. The only piece of feedback that I really have for the experience is that I wish the mentors would have received a bit more training. For example, how to deal with adolescents and the different situations they are in with their friends, how to form relationships with the child's family, etc. Thanks again Mai! With warm regards, mentor team emailed the following back Hi mentor, Thanks for completing the closing and for the feedback! I will contact child and Germaine to do closing as well.

              "'I called mentor after receiving negative and concerning feedback from parent and child. I shared a summary of the very long conversation I had with parent and child during which they repeatedly affirmed their desire to end the match as soon as possible. Their justification was complex but centered around a few things lack of a strong connection -- parent and child both expressed that the bond between child and mentor isn\\'t very strong. They don\\'t have a deep bond erosion of trust -- parent and child feel like they cannot count on mentor to accommodate their needs and adhere to team guidelines. They accuse her of things like inviting other people to attend meetups without informing them, not driving safely, and using guilt or shame to make child feel bad about missing meetups or not wanting to do certain activities clash of personalities -- parent and child both expressed that mentor can be controlling and judgmental. They said mentor would use guilt to manipulate child into doing activities she wasn\\'t interested in, cast judgment on their lifestyle, and disrespect their boundaries (e.x. entering their home uninvited during pick up/drop off and making comments about cleanliness). parent and child also referenced alleged behavior in parent\\'s personal life, accusing her of being a \"stalker\" whose ex-husband put a restraining order out on her. child expressed fear that mentor would \"show up at their house\" after closure, however, parent did not share the same concern. failure to adhere to the team policy of 1-1 meetups -- parent and child indicated that mentor would frequently have other family members present during their meetups. mentor\\' child was brought up a few times as someone who was around often. mentor\\' child is an \"adult,\" which made parent especially concerned. using guilt to emotionally manipulate -- as noted above, parent and child said that mentor would hold things like the cost of a ticket for an event over child\\' head and make her feel bad for not wanting to go or not being able to go issues with planning and communication -- parent believes that parent has \"a lot going on in her life\" that have led to poor communication and inconsistent meetups. inability to accommodate child\\' mental health -- as noted above, parent and child expressed that mentor would not accommodate child\\' mental health needs during certain meetups. From what I have been told, child suffers from social anxiety and some form of bipolar disorcer. They repeatedly mentioned child\\' social anxiety around groups of people, especially new people. The \"last straw,\" as parent put it, was a recent outing to the zoo. parent and child were under the impression that the meeting would be 1-1 and they were surprised and upset to learn that members of mentor\\' family were meeting them there. While at the zoo, child\\' social anxiety was triggered and she desired to leave. child claimed that she asked mentor to take her home during their meetup. mentor was allegedly insistent that child should stay and used language that felt manipulative. parent and child shared that this was same type of guilt tripping that was pervasive in the relationship for a very long time (e.x. mentor would hold the price of admission or the logistical effort she had to invest into an activity as a means to make child feel bad for not wanting to do an activity). child claimed that she reached out to parent via SMS while they were at the zoo and asked parent to convince mentor to take her home. parent and child believe that mentor ignored parent\\'s outreach and coerced child into staying the whole time. parent claimed to reach out to another family member/family friend to have them pick her up from the zoo as well. parent and child claim that child had a panic attack when she returned home from the zoo. parent and child feel like this incident pushed the relationship past the point of repair. They no longer feel like they can trust mentor to take care of child and be responsive to her needs. parent also feels like child has grown a lot and has a much stronger support system around her than she did when the match was introduced. They accuse mentor of being controlling (using guilt on child), inconsistent with meetups (changing plans last second), and judgmental of their lifestyle (making comments about the cleanliness of their home and child contributions to household chores). parent made comments that mentor \"has a lot going on in her personal life\" and doesn\\'t handle rejection well. parent and child also shared that mentor would get into arguments with her child in front of child and these made child uncomfortable. parent is especially concerned that mentor\\' child is around sometimes because he is an adult (age unknown). child\\' concern about mentor\\' family being around centered more around feeling left out, but not necessarily threatened or unsafe. The legitimate safety issue child is more concerned with is mental/emotional, as she struggles to be around too many people, especially those she doesn\\'t know very well. child also accused mentor of inattentive driving (texting) and veering out of the lane. child no longer looks forward to seeing mentor and would like to close the match. After sharing this information, mentor immediately expressed that she was surprised, perhaps even shocked, to learn that parent and child were feeling this way. mentor shared that they had not been meeting up very much recently and that these concerns had never been brought to her attention during the 3.5 years they were together. mentor said that they had visited the zoo before and there were no issues. mentor shared that the family would send child\\' brother along on meetups on multiple occasions. In fact, child\\' brother was tagging along on their last meetup at the zoo (a pretty significant fact that parent and child failed to disclose to me). mentor said that their families have had multiple interactions and she never sensed there were any issues or discomfort. mentor did not realize the trip to the zoo was so \"problematic\" and wishes that parent would have reached out to her directly before choosing to close the match. mentor\\' side of the story is that she already had plans to go to the zoo with members of her own family. She ended up with extra tickets and reached out to parent and child to see if child would like to tag along. mentor admitted that she is unsure whether she told the family that her family would be attending. mentor was supposed to pick up child at 10am but parent wasn?t home. mentor picked up parent from work to go pick up child. mentor child drove mentor and child to the zoo (unsure whether mentor\\' child was driving to transport parent from work). mentor said that child has met her child more than once and the family never expressed any concerns about him or their relationship (specifically, the alleged arguments). mentor sensed that child was losing interest at the zoo and not having a very good time. mentor claimed that she was in contact with parent via SMS while they were at the zoo and refuted that she ignored parent\\'s outreach. mentor shared that child would often have sudden mood swings and lose interest in activities that she had willingly agreed to take part in. mentor said that this was a very common issue in their relationship that she has regularly discussed with parent. mentor has been aware of child\\' mental health challenges (bipolar disorder and social anxiety) and has requested parent\\'s support several times on how to best support child. (previous team\\'s support these claims) mentor said that she is often faced with the conundrum of encouraging child to \"push through\" and stay engaged with an activity vs. taking her home and potentially missing a fun opportunity. mentor said that this trip to the zoo was one of those cases. mentor reaffirmed that she has spoken with parent about this multiple times in the past and requested her guidance and support. mentor expressed a deep sadness and remorse for anything she may have done to cause harm in the relationship. She also expressed frustration, rooted in confusion, and again wished that parent would have said something to her before choosing to close. mentor said that she has received a \"polar opposite\" impression from the family about how things were going. mentor feels like the family has withheld a lot of important information from her that would have been helpful. mentor respects that the family wishes to cease all contact and assured me that she will go along with this. mentor\\' only request is that I pass along an apology to the family, which I agreed to do. mentor suspects that the breakdown in the relationship may be partially the result of child just not liking her. mentor also wondered aloud whether child\\' mental health challenges, exacerbated by COVID, have contributed to this outcome. mentor said that she and parent spoke many times about child\\' recent and significant uptick in depressive mood. I told mentor that I appreciated her willingness to listen intently and calmly to the allegations parent and mentor made against her. I appreciated her honest response about how things unfolded from her perspective. I shared that all parties seemed to be violating team guidelines when it comes to 1-1 meetups and some of the negative outcomes that those guidelines are meant to prevent were realized in their relationship. Open and honest communication was poorly maintained and it\\'s unclear who is most responsible. I confirmed with mentor that there were no incidents of inappropriate behavior between anyone in her family or friend circle and child. I told mentor that the match would be closing and that I would pass along her apologies. I expressed that team likely shares some responsibility in the unraveling of their relationship. I noticed that the match had been through 3 caseload transfers in 3.5 years, which is certainly not ideal. I said that I had received no information from previous team of there being any significatn issues with this match.'"

              "{'sequence': 'I called mentor after receiving negative and concerning feedback from parent and child. I shared a summary of the very long conversation I had with parent and child during which they repeatedly affirmed their desire to end the match as soon as possible. Their justification was complex but centered around a few things lack of a strong connection -- parent and child both expressed that the bond between child and mentor isn\\'t very strong. They don\\'t have a deep bond erosion of trust -- parent and child feel like they cannot count on mentor to accommodate their needs and adhere to team guidelines. They accuse her of things like inviting other people to attend meetups without informing them, not driving safely, and using guilt or shame to make child feel bad about missing meetups or not wanting to do certain activities clash of personalities -- parent and child both expressed that mentor can be controlling and judgmental. They said mentor would use guilt to manipulate child into doing activities she wasn\\'t interested in, cast judgment on their lifestyle, and disrespect their boundaries (e.x. entering their home uninvited during pick up/drop off and making comments about cleanliness). parent and child also referenced alleged behavior in parent\\'s personal life, accusing her of being a \"stalker\" whose ex-husband put a restraining order out on her. child expressed fear that mentor would \"show up at their house\" after closure, however, parent did not share the same concern. failure to adhere to the team policy of 1-1 meetups -- parent and child indicated that mentor would frequently have other family members present during their meetups. mentor\\' child was brought up a few times as someone who was around often. mentor\\' child is an \"adult,\" which made parent especially concerned. using guilt to emotionally manipulate -- as noted above, parent and child said that mentor would hold things like the cost of a ticket for an event over child\\' head and make her feel bad for not wanting to go or not being able to go issues with planning and communication -- parent believes that parent has \"a lot going on in her life\" that have led to poor communication and inconsistent meetups. inability to accommodate child\\' mental health -- as noted above, parent and child expressed that mentor would not accommodate child\\' mental health needs during certain meetups. From what I have been told, child suffers from social anxiety and some form of bipolar disorcer. They repeatedly mentioned child\\' social anxiety around groups of people, especially new people. The \"last straw,\" as parent put it, was a recent outing to the zoo. parent and child were under the impression that the meeting would be 1-1 and they were surprised and upset to learn that members of mentor\\' family were meeting them there. While at the zoo, child\\' social anxiety was triggered and she desired to leave. child claimed that she asked mentor to take her home during their meetup. mentor was allegedly insistent that child should stay and used language that felt manipulative. parent and child shared that this was same type of guilt tripping that was pervasive in the relationship for a very long time (e.x. mentor would hold the price of admission or the logistical effort she had to invest into an activity as a means to make child feel bad for not wanting to do an activity). child claimed that she reached out to parent via SMS while they were at the zoo and asked parent to convince mentor to take her home. parent and child believe that mentor ignored parent\\'s outreach and coerced child into staying the whole time. parent claimed to reach out to another family member/family friend to have them pick her up from the zoo as well. parent and child claim that child had a panic attack when she returned home from the zoo. parent and child feel like this incident pushed the relationship past the point of repair. They no longer feel like they can trust mentor to take care of child and be responsive to her needs. parent also feels like child has grown a lot and has a much stronger support system around her than she did when the match was introduced. They accuse mentor of being controlling (using guilt on child), inconsistent with meetups (changing plans last second), and judgmental of their lifestyle (making comments about the cleanliness of their home and child contributions to household chores). parent made comments that mentor \"has a lot going on in her personal life\" and doesn\\'t handle rejection well. parent and child also shared that mentor would get into arguments with her child in front of child and these made child uncomfortable. parent is especially concerned that mentor\\' child is around sometimes because he is an adult (age unknown). child\\' concern about mentor\\' family being around centered more around feeling left out, but not necessarily threatened or unsafe.
