MEC linked them to the Bigs Newsletter and the Updated in person meeting guidelines which allow matches to meet in person, if participants are open to it, and if they follow the CDC Guidelines. MEC linked her new phone number as this has changed, and a variety of activity resources for both in person and virtual activities. MEC offered an opportunity to connect via phone (scheduling via acuity), complete the online check in, or give MEC a call on her new phone. MORGAN RESPONDED: Hi Jeanna, Hope all is well! My little sister informed me recently that her family is moving to TX in June ? her mom confirmed. I am wondering if they have told you? What does this look like on the BBBS end? I am committed to staying in contact with L_first_name when she moves through call, letters, etc. but I am interested in adding a little sister/brother that is here in MSP so I can continue seeing and spending time with a child!   Let me know what this looks like and what process we can go through!   Thanks,   B_first_name B_last_name MEC RESPONDED VIA EMAIL: Hello B_first_name, Thank you for reaching out. I haven't been able to reach Ralohn so I appreciate the update. I just sent her a \"Please contact me soon\" email as I can't reach you. I can tell you that I have had multiple families say they are going to move and then things change. I would keep that in mind, but we definitely want to plan for positive closure. 1. Start by talking to L_first_name about how their move with change your match. 2. Decide on a way to celebrate your match, the things you've enjoyed, and what you've learned. (It could be a virtual party or a special outing if able). You could also write a letter if you've been unable to connect. 3. Talk with Ralohn about how you plan to stay in touch. Be realistic and communicate that to L_first_name. 4. Have your celebration 5. Go through closure conversation with me and I connect with them as well. I would ask about whether or not you'd like to go through the re-enrollment process at that time. 6. Once the match is officially closed I send a letter saying, \"Any contact you have would be on your own terms\" 7. I get approval for you to go through re-enrollment and then you connect with someone in our enrollment team. I think that's about it. Let me know if you have any other questions or need more specifics.   Thanks! Jeanna\n","  Occurrence 2: Hi B_first_name, I hope you are well. I want to check-in with you and see where things are at for you and the match. I am not sure if you and L_first_name are still meeting at this point or not - could you send me an update?  Thanks so much! Olivia Hi Olivia, Sorry for the delayed reply. I have been living in NJ for a little over a month, it's been a little crazy with the relocation. I will be back in MSP at some point in the next couple weeks and hope to have 1 more hangout with Maks before closing things out. I also don't want to hold him up from future matches, so if you'd prefer to close things out, I'm happy to work with his Mom to setup a goodbye visit at a later date. Just let me know what you think. Thanks, Hi B_first_name, No worries! Thanks so much for getting back to me and updating me where things are at. I love that you'll be seeing him one last time!  I will chat with Jessica and confirm if Maks would like to be rematched. If that's the case, I will close him out right away so that the process can begin of him getting rematched. Our Little Brothers take quite a while to be matched due to the lack of male volunteers. You, of course, are more than welcome to stay in touch with Maks and see him one more time even with being closed out.  Let me know if you have questions!

I wanted to get the two of you connected, B_first_name is in a new match with L_first_name L_last_name and she needs some support. Matched on 3/15 and since then B_first_name has not been able to connect with Little's guardian, when she picked her up for their last outing there was an adult home but not her guardian, older sister. They have an activity scheduled for tonight that was confirmed by Little. My advice was for B_first_name to reach out to older sister and clarify the communication needs before she takes her out. Mary can you please connect with B_first_name and see what we can do to get them off on the right foot.

L_first_name and I are doing great so far. We have had a lot of fun exploring new things together- went to the science museum recently and the art/ice shanties at Lake Harriet to name a couple of things. One thing I was wondering was if you had an email list or an easy way to keep up-to-date on upcoming BBBS events? I know you have the Facebook and website to check events out, but, for example, the event that happened at Loring Park-you had to sign up beforehand and I didn't receive any notification on that. Just want to make sure I'm not missing something. Overall it has been a great experience so far and I think L_first_name and I are creating a bond together - so far so good! I set up a phone check in with you on 2/21. Should I still keep that on my calendar? Thanks, -Joe Sara Huffman 3:26 PM (0 minutes ago) to B_first_name Awesome! Thanks for filling me in. I think your wondering about the Winter Picnic Holidazzle that took place at Loring park. Those invites are sent through email. I looked to make sure you are getting those emails and you are. I'm wondering if they were possibly sent to a separate folder? I do not know why that would be, but technology does goofy stuff some times. Match engagement coordinators also recruit for events like the Winter Carnival too, although they fill up incredibly fast. They are a hit with matches each year. We will have a summer picnic this year so keep an eye out, Ill also give you a heads up! As far as the scheduled appointment, I can cancel that for you. No need to have another conversation. Ill catch you the month after that. :) Glad things are going so well with you and L_first_name.

Please see my answers below -- What were the highlights of your match? Meeting a smart, funny young person! Any regrets or disappointments in your match? No! What are your expectations for contact after the match is closed? Will you continue contact through phone, email, etc?

Do you have any concerns with your Little participating in a new match? No! Overall, I had a good experience with my Little and enjoyed being a Big. The only piece of feedback that I really have for the experience is that I wish the Bigs would have received a bit more training. For example, how to deal with adolescents and the different situations they are in with their friends, how to form relationships with the Little's family, etc. Thanks again Mai!

Big said she can commit to once a month for the summer and then less frequently in the winter. Match discussed wanting to go canoeing and camping together. MEC recommended closing the match this month which allows them to continue their relationship on their own and would allow the camping. Everyone agreed. MEC asked if Little is interested in reenrollment and he said no. MEC recommended final outing before official move.\n","  Occurrence 2: MEC connected with the Big on 3/7 @ 5:20p Big returned MEC's call and was very apologetic about running to the store and missing their scheduled call. MEC asked about their upcoming move and Big shared that she is moving to Nevada to be closer to her kids on the west coast and shared her grief of leaving friends and Little and excitement for this new adventure. MEC asked when the timing of the move is and Big shared that her husband is retiring in a year and a half so he will be staying here to wait that out however they already have the house in NV and she will be spending the next year traveling back and forth. Big shared she wants to keep a relationship and see Little during that time however it won't be as consistent. MEC repeated back what she heard and confirmed it with Big and then suggested that the match can either continue to be supported by BBBS during that time or it can close and continue on it's own. MEC suggested making a bucket list with Little of the top things they would like to do in their time and making a plan for one last big outing to celebrate. MEC shared that it is unlikely that Little will be able to be rematched due to him being 12, the matching having lasted 3+ years and it being a positive match, so emphasized the importance of making this match impactful and important. MEC suggested having a meeting with all participants and MEC's to make a game plan for the next year and half, talk through expectations, and then formally close the match and allowing them to continue their relationship on their own terms. MEC shared that by ending the relationship with the org now as opposed to when her husband finally moves allows us to start that reenrollment process sooner should we be able to. Big agreed that this was a good plan.

I shared a summary of the very long conversation I had with PG and LS during which they repeatedly affirmed their desire to end the match as soon as possible. Their justification was complex but centered around a few things: lack of a strong connection -- PG and LS both expressed that the bond between LS and BS isn't very strong. They don't have a deep bond erosion of trust -- PG and LS feel like they cannot count on BS to accommodate their needs and adhere to BBBS guidelines. They accuse her of things like inviting other people to attend meetups without informing them, not driving safely, and using guilt or shame to make LS feel bad about missing meetups or not wanting to do certain activities clash of personalities -- PG and LS both expressed that BS can be controlling and judgmental. They said BS would use guilt to manipulate LS into doing activities she wasn't interested in, cast judgment on their lifestyle, and disrespect their boundaries (e.x. entering their home uninvited during pick up/drop off and making comments about cleanliness). PG and LS also referenced alleged behavior in PG's personal life, accusing her of being a \"stalker\" whose ex-husband put a restraining order out on her. LS expressed fear that BS would \"show up at their house\" after closure, however, PG did not share the same concern. failure to adhere to the BBBS policy of 1-1 meetups -- PG and LS indicated that BS would frequently have other family members present during their meetups. BS' son was brought up a few times as someone who was around often. BS' son is an \"adult,\" which made PG especially concerned. using guilt to emotionally manipulate -- as noted above, PG and LS said that BS would hold things like the cost of a ticket for an event over LS' head and make her feel bad for not wanting to go or not being able to go issues with planning and communication -- PG believes that PG has \"a lot going on in her life\" that have led to poor communication and inconsistent meetups. inability to accommodate LS' mental health -- as noted above, PG and LS expressed that BS would not accommodate LS' mental health needs during certain meetups. From what I have been told, LS suffers from social anxiety and some form of bipolar disorcer. They repeatedly mentioned LS' social anxiety around groups of people, especially new people. The \"last straw,\" as PG put it, was a recent outing to the zoo. PG and LS were under the impression that the meeting would be 1-1 and they were surprised and upset to learn that members of BS' family were meeting them there. While at the zoo, LS' social anxiety was triggered and she desired to leave. LS claimed that she asked BS to take her home during their meetup. BS was allegedly insistent that LS should stay and used language that felt manipulative. PG and LS shared that this was same type of guilt tripping that was pervasive in the relationship for a very long time (e.x. BS would hold the price of admission or the logistical effort she had to invest into an activity as a means to make LS feel bad for not wanting to do an activity). LS claimed that she reached out to PG via SMS while they were at the zoo and asked PG to convince BS to take her home. PG and LS believe that BS ignored PG's outreach and coerced LS into staying the whole time. PG claimed to reach out to another family member/family friend to have them pick her up from the zoo as well. PG and LS claim that LS had a panic attack when she returned home from the zoo. PG and LS feel like this incident pushed the relationship past the point of repair. They no longer feel like they can trust BS to take care of LS and be responsive to her needs. PG also feels like LS has grown a lot and has a much stronger support system around her than she did when the match was introduced. They accuse BS of being controlling (using guilt on LS), inconsistent with meetups (changing plans last second), and judgmental of their lifestyle (making comments about the cleanliness of their home and LS contributions to household chores). PG made comments that BS \"has a lot going on in her personal life\" and doesn't handle rejection well. PG and LS also shared that BS would get into arguments with her son in front of LS and these made LS uncomfortable. PG is especially concerned that BS' son is around sometimes because he is an adult (age unknown). LS' concern about BS' family being around centered more around feeling left out, but not necessarily threatened or unsafe. The legitimate safety issue LS is more concerned with is mental/emotional, as she struggles to be around too many people, especially those she doesn't know very well. LS also accused BS of inattentive driving (texting) and veering out of the lane. LS no longer looks forward to seeing BS and would like to close the match. After sharing this information, BS immediately expressed that she was surprised, perhaps even shocked, to learn that PG and LS were feeling this way. BS shared that they had not been meeting up very much recently and that these concerns had never been brought to her attention during the 3.5 years they were together. BS said that they had visited the zoo before and there were no issues. BS shared that the family would send LS' brother along on meetups on multiple occasions. In fact, LS' brother was tagging along on their last meetup at the zoo (a pretty significant fact that PG and LS failed to disclose to me). BS said that their families have had multiple interactions and she never sensed there were any issues or discomfort. BS did not realize the trip to the zoo was so \"problematic\" and wishes that PG would have reached out to her directly before choosing to close the match. BS' side of the story is that she already had plans to go to the zoo with members of her own family. She ended up with extra tickets and reached out to PG and LS to see if LS would like to tag along. BS admitted that she is unsure whether she told the family that her family would be attending. BS was supposed to pick up LS at 10am but PG wasn?t home. BS picked up PG from work to go pick up LS. BS son drove BS and LS to the zoo (unsure whether BS' son was driving to transport PG from work). BS said that LS has met her son more than once and the family never expressed any concerns about him or their relationship (specifically, the alleged arguments). BS sensed that LS was losing interest at the zoo and not having a very good time. BS claimed that she was in contact with PG via SMS while they were at the zoo and refuted that she ignored PG's outreach. BS shared that LS would often have sudden mood swings and lose interest in activities that she had willingly agreed to take part in. BS said that this was a very common issue in their relationship that she has regularly discussed with PG. BS has been aware of LS' mental health challenges (bipolar disorder and social anxiety) and has requested PG's support several times on how to best support LS. (previous MSC's support these claims) BS said that she is often faced with the conundrum of encouraging LS to \"push through\" and stay engaged with an activity vs. taking her home and potentially missing a fun opportunity. BS said that this trip to the zoo was one of those cases. BS reaffirmed that she has spoken with PG about this multiple times in the past and requested her guidance and support. BS expressed a deep sadness and remorse for anything she may have done to cause harm in the relationship. She also expressed frustration, rooted in confusion, and again wished that PG would have said something to her before choosing to close. BS said that she has received a \"polar opposite\" impression from the family about how things were going. BS feels like the family has withheld a lot of important information from her that would have been helpful. BS respects that the family wishes to cease all contact and assured me that she will go along with this. BS' only request is that I pass along an apology to the family, which I agreed to do. BS suspects that the breakdown in the relationship may be partially the result of LS just not liking her. BS also wondered aloud whether LS' mental health challenges, exacerbated by COVID, have contributed to this outcome. BS said that she and PG spoke many times about LS' recent and significant uptick in depressive mood. I told BS that I appreciated her willingness to listen intently and calmly to the allegations PG and BS made against her. I appreciated her honest response about how things unfolded from her perspective. I shared that all parties seemed to be violating BBBS guidelines when it comes to 1-1 meetups and some of the negative outcomes that those guidelines are meant to prevent were realized in their relationship. Open and honest communication was poorly maintained and it's unclear who is most responsible. I confirmed with BS that there were no incidents of inappropriate behavior between anyone in her family or friend circle and LS. I told BS that the match would be closing and that I would pass along her apologies. I expressed that BBBS likely shares some responsibility in the unraveling of their relationship. I noticed that the match had been through 3 caseload transfers in 3.5 years, which is certainly not ideal. I said that I had received no information from previous MEC of there being any significatn issues with this match.\n","  Occurrence 2: When MEC asked how things have been with the match, BS said that things have been pretty good. BS stated that LS is 13 and currently having problems with school because she is frequently late and misses the bus often. BS acknowledged that BS would also rather do art than school work because it's what she loves. BS stated that she has a good relationship with PG. Reflecting on the overview of teen programming, BS acknowledged that there are a lot of STEM opportunities , but none for artistic interests. TPC told BS that while we don't have any direct connections to artistic institutions, TPC encouraged BS and LS to visit spaces of LS's interest while taking advantage of college prep opportunities with BBBS. TPC also told BS about the Early Scholarship Program and told BS that she would circle back when applications open.\n","\n","Keyword: bbbs (meaning: team)\n","  Occurrence 1: Question: Activities:           Answer: See mss notes.

Which of these characteristics do you find yourself incorporating the most in your match? How do you personally model expressing care when you?re with your Little? We try to incorporate all the listed characteristics, but we try to be very encouraging. We believe in positive reinforcement and support positive behaviors. How does your Little express care in the relationship? Is their approach different than your own? Brock seems to enjoy the time we spend together, however we have not met much recently. Our In Person Meeting Guidelines (due to COVID) have changed recently. A more formal communication & resources has been emailed to all participants. You may review the guidelines on our website - https://www.bigstwincities.org/2020/09/24/updates-to-covid-19-in-person-mentoring-guidelines/. Do you have any questions or concerns? How do you see this impacting your match? Kelsey and I are not meeting with Brock at this time in person. My mother is very high risk for COVID. Mentoring can be hard work! Is there any way I can help make your match more successful? It has been a challenge with COVID and the lack of in person meetings this year. On a personal note, my mom is terminally ill and we have been dealing with the impact that has. That has taken most of our energy, unfortunately.

In regards to Brock, I hope you have felt comfortable communicating to them what is happening in your life. I'm sure one reason they haven't reached out it to give you space to focus on your mother plus all the emotions that go along with this difficult time. I wouldn't take it seriously. Also, some kids are struggling with so much online socializing/academics. I might see if Jamie & Brock are open to some sort of game or virtual field trip online. There are a lot of ideas on our BBB portal. If you go to Bigstwincities.org and highlight \"Bigs Only\" you'll se an option for Virtual Mentoring. There are a lot of ideas on there.

MEC asked why the break occurred, and BB said his girlfriend broke up with him 4 months ago and he hasn't felt \"in a great position to be a great role model\". MEC said it's understandable to have life circumstances change, but that consistency and communication are important when those things come up. BB agreed and said he was interested in reconnecting with LB. BB then said that just before they stopped getting together, LB had said to BB \"his parents don't love him because they steal from him to buy drugs\". MEC asked if \"buying drugs\" was LBs words or his inference; it was his inference. MEC asked how BB reacted, BB said it made him nervous and he wasn't sure how to approach it so they changed the subject. MEC reminded BB that when those situations come up to contact MEC who will provide resources.  MEC asked what they typically did when they were hanging out, BB said getting tacos and mentioned a \"slumber party\" he had. MEC asked for more information about the slumber party, BB said it was with permission from PG and after the 1 year mark, that LB slept on a couch in a different room. MEC asked if this was cleared with BBBS, BB said no but that it was PG's idea, MEC reminded him that BBBS is not allowing overnights right now and that it needs to be cleared with BBBS anyway, BB said okay. BB also mentioned that LB is \"very high energy\" and is sometimes difficult to control. MEC asked for an example, BB said they sometimes play Dungeons and Dragons at BBs house with some of BBs friends and LB ends up jumping and running around. MEC suggested going forward, match should prioritize high energy, focused activities such as playing sports or exercising. MEC also followed up via email with the suggestion to limit including other people in their get-togethers, as that could put LB on edge and potentially cause the high-energy behavior BB is referring to.\n","  Occurrence 2: Question: Activities:           Answer: MEC completed the quarterly check-in with BB. During their last outing, they played one game of laser tag because the place was closing early. Afterwards, they stopped for ice cream. MEC asked about their next outing. They may go back to the laser tag place because this was the most excited LB have been and he was talkative. MEC asked BB how often they are able to get together. They meet once per month but BB will try to meet every two weeks. MEC asked about communication with mom. BB referred to mom as great and she responds quickly despite BB schedule.

BBBS February 2021 Check In Form Policy & Guideline Reminder WHEN ENGAGING IN HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES (ROCK CLIMBING, SCUBA, WHITE WTER RAFTING, ETC.) --Contact a BBBSTC staff member --Identify any specialized skills, training, equipment, and supervision needed --Teach, practice, and develop necessary skills and safety precautions --Contact parent/guardian for approval --Remember snowmobiles, personal watercraft, motorcycles, go-carts are okay with proper safety training and attire (helmet, life vest, etc.) IMPORTANT: Updated COVID-19 guidelines UPDATED 12/16/2020 Governor Tim Walz has loosened restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 , but warned that caution is still needed to prevent further spread of the virus. The new order, which takes effect at midnight on Saturday, December 19, replaces a four-week pause that prevented Bigs and Littles from meeting in person. Updated guidelines now allow the following: Indoor group gatherings involving up to two households and no more than 10 people; Outdoor gatherings with no more than three households and 15 people. While the governor is allowing indoor gatherings for individuals from two different households, we still encourage matches to meet outdoors whenever possible and limit time in enclosed spaces like vehicles. If you choose to be inside or in a vehicle together, at a minimum we ask you to follow Minnesota Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control guidelines, including wearing a mask, maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet, washing your hands, not touching your face, and staying home if you or someone close to you has symptoms of COVID-19. Try to allow for ventilation through open windows and fresh air when possible. It is the decision of each individual family and volunteer whether to meet in person or virtually. Governor Walz?s new restrictions do not prohibit one-on-one interactions (like a Big and a Little meeting in person) as long as proper safety guidelines are followed. However, all participants must wear a mask while together and all parties must agree to resume meeting in person. If you haven?t already done so, all parties (Big, Little?s parent/guardian) must sign an in-person meeting agreement and acknowledgement form prior to meeting in person. Please refer to ?COVID-19 In-Person Match Meeting Guidelines? in the original blog post below for more information. I have read and fully understand the above child safety policies <OR> Mentoring can be challenging! Is there any way I can help make your match more successful?

Big responded, \"I have seen Sam a couple of times this summer and have been in contact with him by phone and text also, He actually stayed at my house one weekend. It was the 4th of July and a busy weekend, we did some archery, went fishing, played golf and did fireworks. I also got together with him on his birthday in early June. I have plans to spend time with him this weekend, probably go bike riding and then lunch or dinner.\" MC responded, \"Good Afternoon Chuck, Thank you so much for getting back to me. I do want to let you know that overnights are not allowed during this time as this falls under the \"no visits inside\" Covid-19 rules. Also, if you plan to do any more overnights once we are allowed to do them again in the future, they need to be approved by me and BBBS in advance. In addition, during this time, you are not able to transport little because of the 6ft social distance rule. So, if and when you get together it has to be outside at all times. Below is a link to the Covid-19 rules for further information about the restrictions during this time. Please let me know if you have any questions. I am glad you have been able to see each other, especially during this crazy time. It's nice to feel some normalcy once and a while! Enjoy the rest of your summer! Sincerely, Guidelines:  https://conta.cc/3hgQV2I To date, Big has not yet responded to MC. MC will connect with little's guardian and be sure to state the guidelines at this as well.

She said that they took LB to do the dog park with their dog, Oliver, and he had a BLAST running around, having the BCs do work out moves and then tossing the football in another part of the park. BS said that she was concerned LB's sister would have been distressed when they came to pick up LB; instead she was happy to have 1:1 time with Gma to make slime or paint nails. BS said that LB talked nonstop, he has a \"super fun\" personality, and he is VERY knowledgeable about football and sport stats in general. She said that Gma has been responsive and communicative; she and BB are grateful to have been matched with such a kind family. They all text to make and confirm plans. The three have plans to get together again this coming weekend, and they're aiming to do match activities every other week as long as schedules permit. When asked, BS confirmed no worries, no concerns and no need for follow up at this time. It was easy to spontaneously do in person support with BS but make time to also talk with her more confidentially over the phone and/or via email. I was also able to see BS in person on 5/13 at the Saints game and picnic since she was working the event. She is a warm, engaged, enthusiastic BS.\n","  Occurrence 2: MEC asked how things have been going with the match, BC said that they've gotten together about three times since we checked in last. Big couple said little came over to their house and baked brownies which was so fun. BC said they also painted in the park recently. BC said Little seems very cool with things and is happy with the match. Big said they noticed that at the last meetup Little was a bit more distant but he's got middle school coming up in a lot on his mind, they noted that Little fell asleep in the car which they thought was very sweet. MEC helped them reflect on the fact that sometimes we all have days where we feel a little grumpy or off and that was probably what was going on with Little, BC agreed. MEC circled back to Little visiting Bigs home, and noted that we haven't closed the loop on approving home visits with the family. MEC said that clearly PG was okay with it because she let her child go to BCs house, but we have to make sure that we do the due diligence on our end. BC said they totally thought that PG had approved because they had mentioned that to her, and they're totally fine with waiting until MEC follows up. Big couple said they're hoping to go to Wheel Fun Rentals next time they get together. MEC said that will be a blast. MEC asked if they had any further questions or needs, BC mentioned that they feel like right now the main purpose of their relationship is just to have fun and ask if they should be doing something more or aiming for something more. MEC said it really is just about having fun especially in the beginning stage as they're getting to know each other and developing their relationship. MEC noted that as time goes on it's really dependent on the needs of the Little and the dynamic of the specific relationship, some matches have specific things that they're working towards or directions that they're going, and some are really about just having people to spend time with and do things with. Big said that helps and they are really happy with how things going. MEC thanked BC for their time and noted how they are so mindful and thoughtful about their relationship which is fantastic. MEC encouraged BC to reach out if they needed anything further.\n","\n","Keyword: bss (meaning: mentor)\n","  Occurrence 1: MEC introduced himself to BS. MEC asked how the match has been lately. BS said she?s been having a lot of concern and apprehension. MEC asked BS to tell MEC about it. BS said sure. BS said they?ve been matched around three years, and it?s been pretty good up until 6 months-year ago. BS said LS has been going through a lot of emotional/anger issues at home. BS said the lack of consistency with school hasn?t helped with this. BS said they hadn?t seen each other in person for a while, but had talked on the phone a bit. BS said PG was feeling unsure about the relationship BSS heard from prior MEC, so BS made a real effort to reach out. BS said they?ve had four different plans to meet up since then. BS said she comes from Spring valley, WI, which is about an hour away. BS said it?s been tough each time. BS said the first time BS drove all the way there, and LS wasn?t there. PG told BS that LS had ran away, and PG didn?t know where she was.. BS said the second time BS was 20 minutes down the road and PG called to cancel because LS was at her friends house. BS said the third attempt they did hang out a few hours, but LS said she wanted to go back home because she had a friend there waiting for her. BS said the 4th time BS was again 15 minutes down the road and they cancelled again. BS said she?s just unsure where LS is at with the match. MEC said sure, and apologized to BS for the challenges. MEC said that would be frustrating. MEC talked with BS about having an intentional conversation with PG about the match, distance, scheduling, communication, and where she feels LS is at with the match. MEC suggested BS let PG know she?ll talk with LS about this as well, but wanting to get PGs take. BS said she?ll do that. MEC encouraged BS to connect with them at some point over the next week. BS said she?ll do that. MEC asked BS to let MEC know what comes of that. BS said will do.\n","  Occurrence 2: MEC called BS, and reiterated positive message from email, that LB kept BS's card. BS said yeah, that's sweet. MEC said that through his conversation with PG, he gets the feeling PG isn't quite clear on what their match frequency/consistency plan is. MEC said he knows they all discussed this in fall/winter, but can't recall what their plan. was. BS said yeah, they did talk about it, came up with a plan, but when covid came around it all kind of fell apart. MEC said sure, gotcha. MEC asked if BS saw updated temporary guidelines around in person meetings. BS said she hadn't, but was keeping her eye out for them. MEC reiterated guidelines, and said he'd email them to BS. BS said sounds good, and said she'd like to get back to in person. MEC said he'd like for BS to connect with PG about frequency, consistency, communication. MEC told BS that some PG's need more reassurance and communication then others to feel good about their child's relationship. MEC said he thinks PG is looking for clarity, or a more specific plan. BSS talked with MEC about her schedule, and how it rotates, and changes each week. MEC said sure. MEC said he feels they can come up with a plan that is both flexible and intentional, and that gets them all on the same page. BS said they did this those months ago, but said she'll connect with PG again. MEC said sure, I think PG just feels like they haven't been connecting at least twice a month, so a convo on things now that guidelines have been adjusted will serve everyone well. MEC said he feels this is best as a phone call, as things can get lost in translation via text. BS said sure. BS said cause at times when she's said things to PG she hasn't gotten a response back. MEC said sure. MEC said likely both of their communication styles are a little different, so phone calls would likely help improve that. BS said makes sense. MEC said he'll tee up their conversation via email, and told BS to let MEC know if he can support her and their plan in any way. BS said will do.\n","\n","Keyword: bd (meaning: mentor)\n","  Occurrence 1: Bs said that she has moved and is pretty much settled in her new home, in Big Lake. She has not as yet talked to mother about Bs having to close the match in October because of the move. She said that she continues to have some difficulties trying to get Ls to be more positive about things. Ls never has ideas of things to do, and if she does, like go bowling, when she is there she says she is not having a good time. Bs took her to the Saints game, and Ls said it wasn't her thing but like the other activities. There were some things that Bs observed with ls and other kids. LS knew a lot of kids that were there, and talked about how excited she was to sit by a certain girl ignored her, and the didn't talk. Ls said that the girl went to Ls's bd party, but only because their mothers were friends. Ls seems really negative to bs, who continues to try to tease her, and sometimes do some things like dancing at the Saints game, that bs was trying to tease Ls into smiling, but ls just covered her face. Bs said that she thinks it must be hard on ls going back and forth between the parents, and Bs said that she gets hints now and then that Ls gets various opinions of what Ls should do, etc. from the parents. For example, Ls had a piano concert and dad said she didn't have to go and mom said she did. Ls went to the concert, and mom said she played well, and dad said she had made mistakes. So, I agreed with Bs that Ls probably is having some problems with this and that it was good that she recognized and seemed to understand this. Nonetheless , bs said said it was like pulling teeth to get ls to be positive about anything. We talked about how maybe Bs could call mom up and talk with her in a positive way .. saying that Bs would like the match to be more fulfilling and fun for ls and it doesn't seem that it always is, and what does mom suggest. Bs said that mom always tells her ls has a blast when match is together, Mom also told Bs that Ls was crazy about the SAints game, but that surely is not what Ls acted like when they were together. Ls said she didn't understand what was going on, Bs then tried to explain the game to her, and ls said she was going to cheer for the other team. ' Another example is that ls knows that Bs works at Target, and ls tells her that she likes Walmart better than target.. Bs laughs this off, but it does seem to be hard for her as LS doesn't seem at this time to be able to enjoy what they are doing. Bs said she is still hanging in there, and the match is okay.. She doesn't seem discouraged, she kind of laughs as she tells me things and does seem to talk about ls kindly.. I told her that it was great that she was so understanding as probably the current home situation is stressful for ls. She said nothing else was of any consequence. They are planning to go to the BBBS at Lake Phaelen, and she said tht she does try to get ls to do things outside, and be with other kids, as it sounds as if Ls does a lot of watching utube. She thanked me for checking on her.\n","  Occurrence 2: Question: Activities:           Answer: I had really a hard time understanding Bs. I kept repeating what I thought she was saying. She had a really bad cold. She tries to get together two or three time a month, but they were going to get together recently but she had to cancel out. Ls told Bd that roller skating was her very favorite thing but when they did it,ls got tired very early on in the activity. This happened when they went ice skating at the BBBS event, and BS tried to explain to her that skill comes with practice, and keeping doing the activity many times. BS talked with her mother and siblings and they said that this is typical of a 9 year old. Bs said that there next event is to go to BS's apt. building and make cookies in the community room., and maybe watch a movie. She said that she felt that mom and Ls both have separation anxiety. Mom did go along for two or three match activities, but no longer. However, there are a lot of checking with each other, mom and ls, about doing something. Bs is trying to figure out what issues ls/mom have, so she thinks it will be better if they can do their activity in the community room. I asked if mom would be concerned if there were others using the space, and she doesn't know. She is trying to figure this all out. She feels mom might be concerned about this, but ls may be more worried about being alone with bs in her apartment. In regard to their relationship, Bs said that she feels that they both are opening up to each other. She does sound frustrated because ls has difficulty staying positive about what they are doing.. kinda sounds as if ls complains after a while. Bs seems to be trying to figure out how to handle this, but it must be somewhat discouraging. She says thought that she ls may not sound very excited about what they do, she said that mom says that she is.. Bs says that ls seems more guarded talking around her mother, but when she is with BS she is goofy, and fun , that she cracks BS up.. and Bs finds i fun. Mom and bs mostly communicate viat exting. Bs feels that she has to make sure she doesn't set up really long activities, because she feels this causes ls stress, and perhaps mother. She feels they both have separation anxiety. Ls seems to do okay in school, that she does her homework. She says she is not learning anything about school. LS was in a Christmas play and really enjoyed that. Ls also plays the piano and Bs hopes to go to one ofLs's concerts when she has them. I did suggest that perhaps Bs could find a community play around town, or a play at the Stages theatre that is fairly inexpensive. Bs thought this was a great idea. bs said that she was enjoying the match and is looking forward to the summer. She said ls is a great kid.

When asked, BB confirmed 0 meetups or hours spent together this month and said he would like to \"do better.\" next month. He and I confirmed that he would make an attempt to actually CALL Mom and I will call/text/email her. The agreement is that he will propose several match activity dates at once in hopes that the two can restart momentum on their match. I also sent BB an activity email (that hadn't yet been logged in MF bc of the recent transition): Mary Callahan Schreiber   < email_address > Mon, Feb 25, 12:39 PM (3 days ago) to  me , bcc:  Onna , bcc:  Chad , bcc:  Nina , bcc:  Ashley , bcc:  Joe , bcc:  Mallory , bcc:  Cheryl , bcc:  Margaret , bcc:  matthew Greetings Bigs, Due to weather, our popular BBBS activity  A Night at Base Camp  was rescheduled for THURSDAY, MARCH 7th.

I have been in touch with both B_first_name and LB, and both are excited to get things going again. Most matches will be re-connecting within the next week. B_first_name and his BL are scheduled to reconnect tomorrow, Wednesday, Sept 20th. With no match contact, I have no concerns about child safety within the context of this program.

The match meeting with pretty low-key; MC made sure everyone knew who they are matched with, MC went over the plan for meeting one-on-one and how everything is going to work, gave them time to connect, and MC answered questions. B_first_name is the school resource officer and works in the school, thus he and LB are able to connect regularly and set up time that works for them. They do not have a set regular weekly meeting time. MC does not have any safety concerns. B_first_name feels things are going well; he said that they meet several times a week for shorter visits, but it adds up to at least an hour of one-on-one time a week. The match has somewhat of a relationship from getting to know each other during the group program last year, but they are also enjoying their one-on-one time. Not to much to say at this time, they have not been meeting one-on-one for very long. Question: Child Safety:           Answer: . Question: Child Development:           Answer: .

It was good to get a chance to meet this match, which is still quite new. MEC asked how things were going, BS said good but that she was disappointed in the rain. BS had just gotten back from a work trip and a vacation, so they had had a brief lull in meetings, but are getting right back at it. BS reiterated the first two meetings that they had done- making slime as well as making cookies. The pair was good to see together, and they looked more natural than one may have expected at first given that both can be a bit more on the quiet side. MEC was able to observe the pair having good conversation, chatting, and looking like they were having an enjoyable time. This was their first meeting outside of LB's house, so overall, good to see them get out and having fun.

One of the main reasons I thought they'd be a good match is that they both enjoy a wide range of activities and love learning. In addition, mentor has both a laid back, and outgoing personality, and child's personality is similar.

Both took a little bit of time to warm up initially, but became very engaging and fun-loving. Shared Interests: socializing with friends, reading, active, arts/crafts. Both are open to a variety of things. Additional information: A little bit of background why team is making this match: child is adopted to 2 white moms, but moms really want child to have a strong, black female role model for child because they understand they aren't able to fill that role. With the adoption transition, they want someone who she can identify with and look up to. Because child comes from a tougher background, moms do not want her perception of being Black tied with her mother's past thus reaching out to the program for the 1:1 role. mentor is a independent, hard-working, driven black female. She is passionate about social justice, race, and providing guidance to young, black girls. She understands what it means to not only be Black in the country, but also an immigrant. team believes both fill what the other are looking for in terms of making that impact. Another thing to note is the family has plans to move to CA in the next year or two, and mentor is finishing her residency in MN around the same time (Summer 2020) and isn't sure what her plans are after -- she mentioned potentially moving back to NYC. team believes this will work out very nicely to each other's potential schedules, while still giving them enough time to enjoy an impactful

Please let me know if anything would be helpful! team connected with mentor on 9/25 @ 9a team asked how mentor's summer has been and he shared he has been busy and can't really remember when he last saw child but that he took him to a STEM event in June maybe. mentor shared he has been busy with his grandkids but hopes things are slowing down here. However mentor's parents live on their own and are pretty vulnerable and his dad fractured his vertebrate so he may need to be around more from them if things get worse. mentor said that he is the only one to initiate with the match which he understands as child seems to bounce back and forth between PG (grandma) and his mom. team said it sounds like he has been busy and it sounds like things may be slowing down soon, and asked if that was correct. mentor said yes and then shared that his wife's aunt passed and they are traveling to her funeral in Winona this coming week so maybe after that. mentor said he \\\"has a burner account\\\" that he uses to keep an eye on the mentor's FB page. He appreciates the suggestions which make it easy for him to participate. mentor said that child is pretty good at science so he has been trying to lean into that. team suggested using our discount for the Science Museum and asked if mentor knew how to access those discounts which he said he did and that he has taken the grandkids to the museum before. mentor said that child now lives in a new neighborhood and now it takes 25 minutes to get to him so to then drive 30 minutes in the other direction, and then 30 minutes back is a lot sometimes. mentor said he appreciates that our office is only 10 minutes from child so that is a great place to attend events. team asked how the STEM event went and mentor said good and that child is quite good at that and that he himself was a programmer for Microsoft so wants to share those skills. mentor shared a memory of first being matched during the pandemic and not being able to see each other in person and that child so easily knew how to change backgrounds and other cool things on Zoom. mentor said that litte loves video games so he is trying to lean into that interest. team celebrated that and reminded him he is approaching his 4 year anniversary next month and encouraged them to find a way to celebrate. team asked what grade child was in. mentor said he thinks he is in now in 8th grade. team asked if child seems interested or stressed by school. mentor said he seems to like it although there was a time where he was suspended for bringing a fake knife to school but that for the most part he seems to like it. mentor said that child has said on school breaks that \\\"he would rather be in school\\\" which mentor imagines is because of \\\"drama going on at home with his mom\\\" which is likely why he goes back and forth between her house and PG's. mentor shared that child's twin brother was bullied and had to change schools because of that. mentor shared that it was at this time in his first match, a decade ago, where child \\\"got into smoking weed, skipping class and no longer interested in hanging out with me\\\" so the match ended but child did invite him to his GED ceremony and he writes him Christmas cards every year. mentor shared that that child is now a parent. team asked if anything would be helpful and mentor said no that he feels supported. team June '24 mentors Check-In Form w/ Nicki I am so excited to be a part of your Match Support Team!

I hope you are doing much better now. Thanks for the update on you and child. I know that finding Match activities is not always the easiest, and it can be hard to tell if everyone is enjoying it. My suggestion would be to continue to check in with child and Teri for feedback, and perhaps make a bucket list of activities you both would like to do together per season or for the year. Take pictures and make a collage or a scrapbook to look back at the anniversary date. From my last check in with child, he shared with me about activities that he would like to do with you. When it comes to virtual activities, he likes to play the Amongst Us game. He is also open to simple activities such as Go Fish! Uno! And board games such as checkers. He loves the arcade! He also said he wants to be a chef and a basketball player when he grows up. From these information, I think it would be great for you to reflect on it, and connect with child and Teri on what works for you both to get together. I am open to a phone conversation if you like. Do let me know how I can be of further support. Activity suggestion: https://www.lasagnalove.org/ Matches could sign up to make a Lasagna OR we could share with families. I hope that as the weather gets warmer, there will be more opportunities to get out and enjoy more activities. Hopefully, I get to see your Match at future team events. Thanks.

I wanted to share a brief recap about our EXPLORE | Aviation with MN ACE Camp event we held this past Saturday. The event was designed to expose matches to the variety of careers within the Aviation field. We first got to experience going through TSA...that was as pleasant as usual! They were able to sit in the cockpit of THE plane that the Vikings were taking later that afternoon. They went up into the \\\"tower\\\" where everything DELTA takes place. From tracking your luggage to make sure it gets on your flight, to making sure the plane gets filled with water, to seeing where the plane gets de-iced. It was a long event (four hours) but we were able to see and hear about so much!   There were a couple matches that let me know ahead of time that they weren't able to attend anymore. So, with the matches that remained, 100% of them showed up! I let them know that it was a big deal and that it was a first for me in all my time at team. There was even one Central and two Southern matches that came!   Below is the list of matches that came as well as the ones that didn't (again, they let me know ahead of time.)   Explore Aviation Attendance 11/5/22   Below is the link to the program evals. Only three of the youth filled it out so far and seven of the adults. We are in the process of reaching out to those that didn't fill it out. The questions that have (ACE) in front of them, where questions from MN ACE Camp. Also, attached is the eventbrite registration excel sheet.  Feel free to use their responses for match support.   Survey Eval - LITTLE   Survey Eval - BIG Attached are a couple photos of what we experienced! Thank you again for all of your efforts in promoting this event. In the aviation world, it is very rare that everything goes according to plan. Since this was MN ACE Camp's first event, I think they learned a lot. Therefore, I think these events will keep getting better and better!   If you have any or hear any feedback, please let us know. We are always wanting to improve the program experience for our participants. Thanks again!

Thanks, Mai\",\n          \" Activities:Match is currently not meeting due to summer vacation. I have no safety concerns.  Activities:mentor and child have been meeting consistently this year and are doing quite well together. I see and chat with them on a weekly basis. They are very cute together and seem to have a great connection, although child was skeptical at first about having a mentor Sister, rather than mentor Brother. mentor said \\\"he's a cool kid. He makes me laugh.\\\" She said they like to spend most of their free time together coloring and talking about their weeks. child has also been teaching mentor about Pokemon, which is his favorite hobby. They're off to a great start and I have no safety concerns.  Activities:child and Ana have finished match meetings for the year. They met fairly consistently this year, although Ana missed three meetings due to work and illness. It hadn't been apparent to me, but child's mother reached out and let me know that child had taken her absences very hard, and she was highly concerned, asking that he be rematched. We talked through this, and I let her know that Ana's attendance was much more consistent than average, and that some absences were to be expected. We decided to leave the decision up to child, and he stated to me several times that he \\\"definitely\\\" wanted to be matched with Ana and keep meeting with her next year, if possible. We'll check in again in the fall to see where all parties are. I have no safety concerns.  Activities:Match is currently meeting on a weekly basis and is doing well. I see and interact with them every week. I have no safety concerns.  Activities:mentor and child have been meeting for a couple of weeks and are doing well. During their first meeting, child was very reserved and seemed disappointed about not having a mentor Brother, but he started to warm up. They played board games and completed a match icebreaker. mentor said \\\"child is really smart and he likes to talk about things that he knows / things that interest him. I'm looking forward to getting to know him better.\\\" They're off to a good start and I have no concerns.  Activities:Match is currently not meeting due to summer vacation. I have no safety concerns.  Activities:Match is currently meeting (aside from winter break) and is doing very well. I see and interact with them every week, as they meet during group program and are always supervised. They're doing well and I have no concerns.\",\n          \"First Name mentor Last Name mentor Ticket Type Winter Picnic ? Community-Based Matches child's Full Name: child Tolles Who is your team?

Thank you for joining us at the Winter Picnic at Holidazzle yesterday! I hope braving the cold was worth it for games, treats, and being in community with other matches and families. :) Amina, the family coordinator for your match, mentioned she saw you two at registration and that it seemed like you and child were having a good time together! From your registration form, it sounds like things are moving in the right direction and that you're doing some fun activities together. I'd love for us to get on the phone some time in January so I can hear more about how things are going! You can schedule a call for us here .  Your registration and attendance for Holidazzle counts as your check-in this month! Keep in mind that our office is closed from 12/23-27.

Thanks mentor mentor  Andrea Collins 2:33?PM (0 minutes ago) to  mentor Hi mentor! Thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately we do not have a discounted partnership with any bowling alleys (though that's definitely something I can recommend our team look further into). The cheapest bowling I'm aware of is at  Town Hall Lanes , which is priced at $4 per person per game + $3.50 for shoes. They also have some specials during the day which isn't convenient timing of course, but could be interesting if there's a weekday you both happen to have off!  I also saw that you registered for the Explore Dance event on 10/12 that unfortunately had to be cancelled. I had a chance to review your registration form and will definitely continue to keep an ear/eye out for theater/musical event opportunities for you all! Overall, it sounds like things are starting to pick up in your match. I'd love to hear an update about how things are going! You can share that via email here or  schedule a call  with me, either works great for me. :)  Thank you! Hi mentor, I hope you had a nice weekend. I was wondering if you had any follow up thoughts from our conversation from last week or made a decision on how you'd like to move forward? If you'd like to discuss further, just let me know. Thanks! Andy mentor mentor Tue, Sep 3, 3:36?PM to  me Hello, I am leaning towards giving it one last shot with the understanding that there will be a conversation with Lasha and Amina by 9/10 or 11 since I'm getting back to you later in the day. I still want to have one more conversation with my partner and make sure he is on board because he was really not happy with the impact things were having on me. Thanks for following up and I will email you this evening after talking with Scott. Thanks for all your support, mentor mentor  phone_number  mentor mentor Tue, Sep 3, 5:20?PM to  me Hello, I talked through things with Scott again. I would like to continue for now with the understanding that Lasha and Amina will have a coaching session about communication and that improves. Can we touch base again after Amina and Lasha connect or on 9/11 if they don't? Thank you, mentor mentor  Andrea Collins   < email_address > Wed, Sep 4, 1:21?PM to  mentor Hi mentor, Absolutely. I appreciate your willingness to continue and understand that there need to be improvements in order for the match to be successful. What time on 9/11 works for you to connect?  Thanks, Andy Andrea Collins   < email_address > Mon, Sep 9, 10:19?AM to  mentor , bcc:  Amina Hey mentor! Amina had a great conversation with Lasha and child and I am really hopeful for things moving forward. One strategy I'm really excited about (and that Lasha and Z were also very on board with) is the idea of finding a day that can be a standing meeting day, like planning to meet every Saturday or every other Saturday. They also discussed having more open conversations about budgeting / spending money for outings to make sure everyone is on the same page.  My hope is that you and Lasha have or will soon connect and that these ideas help to create stronger lines of communication and more consistency within your match! We will continue to support you all in strengthening your dialogue and relationship by seeing how these strategies work by checking in each month to hear how it's going and provide feedback and further guidance.  Please let me know if you have any further thoughts, questions, or needs!  Warmly, Andy  mentor mentor Mon, Sep 9, 1:54?PM to  me Hi Andy, I apologize for not getting back to you with a time. It's our first week with students and I just got my definite schedule for this week. I'm glad things went well with the conversation. I'd be happy to set a regular schedule. That is something I've tried to mention before but hasn't really gone anywhere and when you and I discussed it, we knew it would limit the free team events we are able to attend. But I'm happy to give it a shot. At the meet and greet team staff attempted to facilitate a budgeting discussion, but Lasha completely avoided that topic. I've tried suggesting certain dollar amounts and haven't been given any feedback from Lasha about those amounts. I don't really know how to facilitate that discussion appropriately. What tips do you have for bringing that up? I haven't heard from Lasha other than a request to sign up for the Twins Suite which I was able to do. I'll text her after work and ask her to schedule a time we can have a phone call or if I can chat with her before the twins game so we can better understand what scheduling and budgeting works for everyone. Does that seem like a good next step? Does she know you are sharing information from that canversation with Amina with me? Can I just ask to talk in real time about what was discussed? Or do I need to approach it a different way? I am hopeful that it all works out and excited to continue seeing child. I'm also still wary of things not changing at all. I'm trying to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and have a fresh start while also taking care of me.  Thank you so much for the time and effort you've put into helping to make this work for everyone involved! mentor mentor  Andrea Collins   < email_address > Mon, Sep 9, 4:31?PM to  mentor , bcc:  Amina Hi mentor, No worries, I get it! For budgeting, I think the bottom line for this will be to establish and hold your own boundaries, as you've already done well. You can approach a conversation with Lasha by saying that you want to make sure this is financially sustainable for everyone and sharing the amount that you are willing to spend monthly and asking her thoughts, and how she'd like to plan ahead for costs of outings. If a suggested activity would cost more than your budget, then saying \\\"Unfortunately that doesn't fit into the budget this month, let's see if we could do that in a couple months!\\\" is a good way to maintain that boundary. I'm glad to hear you'll be attending the Twins Suite, I think that will be a blast! I think it would be a good idea to ask for a phone call check-in or a touchbase before that. I would recommend against directly referencing that I'm sharing some pieces from their conversation. Instead, I think saying that you want to make sure the match gets together consistently, acknowledging that it's been challenging to align your schedules (especially considering the start of Z's school year and your newly busier work schedule!), and that we talked about finding a standing meeting day as a way to tend to that would be a good way to start the conversation. If Saturdays end up being a good fit, we have Match Hangouts on Saturdays typically once per month! It's going to take some continued conversations and probably some trial and error to get to a place where it works for everyone. I and Amina will continue to provide feedback and see how things are going. I'm hopeful, and I also acknowledge that it may end up not being the right fit. I really appreciate you being willing to try. Thank you! Andy  mentor mentor Tue, Sep 10, 6:44?PM to  me Hello, Thank you so much for the advice. Lasha did text me yesterday evening asking to connect about setting up some dates and budgeting. We just got off the phone. We talked through scheduling/budgeting/activity ideas/transportation and I think we have a plan to work with going forward. For now we're marking every other saturday starting with the Twins game going through November. Then we'll touch base again October-ish to plan around holiday events. Thank you for the support and I'll keep you posted on how things go! mentor mentor It went really well! We went \\\"window shopping\\\" at the mall. She looked at stuff she might want for volleyball which she's starting this year for the first time. On the way home she was really happy and when a certain song came in the radio she said \\\"This fills my soul.\\\" It's the most upbeat and happy that I've seen her so far - I really enjoyed that. I saw her mom when I first picked up Z and we had a chance to chat for a couple minutes. We talked about the back to school summer fair and we'll sign up for that. But I didn't see her after or get a chance to talk about our next hang out. Z and I talked about going to a craft thrift store and then heading to my place to make jewelry (one of the activity ideas that she marked as being interested in) for our next hang out. I proposed this coming Monday because she's going out of town the end of next week. So I texted her mom with the exact date, time, and activity idea to see if that plan works. I also asked what she thought of each of us chipping in $10 for the craft supplies. Hopefully I hear back soon. Z hasn't been to my house yet. I knew we needed to wait a few months, but couldn't remember if there's anything else I need to do before her first time here. What is the process for matches hanging out at the big's house? Thanks again for all your support and encouragement! mentor mentor  Andrea Collins   < email_address > Fri, Aug 2, 1:57?PM to  mentor Hi mentor! I'm so excited to hear that you had such a great time and things are looking like they're moving in the right direction! You are right that home visits require an approval process. See below for a note of the policies I need you to review to approve on our end. The family coordinator, Amina, can follow up with Lasha to start the approval process with her. I anticipate that we likely wouldn't be able to complete these steps before Monday, so I would recommend crafting in the park, at a community center, at a coffee shop (I support a match that regularly crafts at Caribou!), or another location! Also, I appreciate that you're being thoughtful and direct about outing costs with Lasha.  It might be too quick of a turnaround for you to get to the office but I could put in a request for some basic craft supplies with our Free Arts program if you'd like! I can't guarantee that we can fill it but especially if you just need paper / string / glue, I have a feeling that it would be easy for them to fill. You'd have to come by the office on Monday, but I'll be there until at least 5 or 6 anyway! Let me know if you want to try for that!  The first step towards approving home visits is having you review some safety information. Please review the   Child Safety Policies & Guidelines , paying close attention to the following policies. Let me know that you've reviewed them and any questions you might have. 1). Supervision and transportation of child/youth 2.) Involving family members/friends on match activities. 3.) Overnight Match Activities are not permitted. 4.) Pet care/control Thanks! Let me know if you have any questions!!  mentor mentor Fri, Aug 2, 8:07?PM to  me Hello, I have reviewed the safety policies and guidelines and I do not have any questions. Please let me know next steps. I realized the thrift store is only open on Thursday/Friday/Saturday, so we're going to plan something different. I'm still waiting to hear confirmation from Lasha that Z is available on Monday at 12. I sent a text earlier this evening letting her know we would have to change the activity, and asking a 2nd time if Monday at 12 was a good time. Thanks for offering to get the crafting supplies - we were thinking something along the lines of jewelry I think. child is pretty creative, so I think a good part of the fun would be seeing what she comes up with from the inspiration at the thrift store - so I'll just save that for another day when they're open. mentor mentor Andrea Collins   < email_address > Mon, Aug 5, 11:06?AM to  mentor Next steps for home visits is the family coordinator will review the same policies with Lasha and Z and ensure they are on board. Once they do, I'll circle back with you to confirm and officially approve home visits moving forward! I will also note that she hasn't yet had an opportunity to connect with them for a check-in, where she'll review home visits as well as the other topics we've been discussing (consistency, confirming outings, budgeting, etc).  My fingers are crossed that today works out! Thanks for clarifying also about the jewellery -- I misinterpreted and thought you were thinking about making paper beads! Hunting for jewelry and supplies at the thrift is such a sweet idea and I'm excited to see your creations. :)  mentor mentor Mon, Aug 5, 11:09?AM to  me I was literally typing up another response and about to hit send when your email came through: Hello, I just wanted to update you on communication since our last meet-up. Thursday 8/1 - I texted Lasha on as soon as I dropped Z off to ask if Monday (today) worked for child's schedule for our next meet up - she responded to a different text about how positive our window shopping day was. But, she didn't say anything about the schedule.  Friday 8/2 - I texted Lasha and child to let them know the craft store isn't open on Monday's and asked again if Monday at noon was good for their schedule, I would share a couple of alternative options. I got no response. Sunday 8/4 - I texted Lasha and child and said that I had to schedule an appointment and since I hadn't received confirmation about Z's schedule, I had to schedule it mid-day and would not be available. I offered to sign us up for the Open Gym Event, but forgot that's the day before Z gets back into town. Lasha texted back that Z would be out of town that date and that is all she said. I replied immediately thanking her for reminding me of that trip. I said we're signed up for the Back-to-School event on 8/24 (which we spoke about previously) and asked if it would work for me to meet them at team since their whole family is going. I have received no response confirming a meeting location/time. I'll reach back out in a few days once Z and some of her sisters are out of town so maybe things will be a little less hectic for Lasha and it may be easier for her to respond. I plan on showing up to the Back-to-School event with 2-3 dates in September and activities and having an in person conversation to confirm dates/times/etc. Please let me know if you think I should do anything differently than what I have planned. Thank you, mentor mentor Andrea Collins   < email_address > Tue, Aug 6, 12:42?PM (13 days ago) to  mentor Thank you for keeping me updated, the context is really helpful! I can definitely understand it being frustrating that you are not getting many responses specifically around scheduling and confirming outings. I really appreciate how you are thinking through different ways to meet her where she's at -- I think your idea of scheduling September dates in person is excellent! If that is successful, you could point out that this was a lot easier and suggest you always try to plan out a month in advance in person. mentor said the match is starting to be more stressful and frustrating than anything else due to communication with PG. mentor said she doesn?t want to ?bail? on child but it has been really challenging. mentor shared that she had reached out to schedule outings and tried to get a time scheduled but PG wouldn?t agree on a time that works. Then PG sent a couple of team activities which they went to, and child expressed that she doesn?t really want to do team activities. child shared that she?d be out of town for the following two weeks so mentor reached out to PG in their group text after child was back to schedule something and PG agreed on the date/time. mentor sent a confirmation text the day before and PG said child is at grandma?s house so wouldn?t be able to. mentor said she thought they had something scheduled, and PG said ?sorry you scheduled something with her.? mentor felt frustrated by that because she scheduled it directly with PG. mentor said that per team advice she went through a list of activities with child who only highlighted the ones that cost money, and PG has only sent a few dollars with child whenever they?ve done activities like that, not enough to cover the cost. mentor said at the match introduction, PG avoided the conversation about budgeting. mentor said she suggested they go to the library and PG said child loves the library so they made a plan, but then PG shared about a grand opening event for a new Boba place and suggested they do that, which mentor was frustrated about because they already had a plan that didn?t cost any money. mentor responded to PG that if child is sent with some money they could do that in addition to the library. mentor said when they do get together mentor and child have a good time, but working with PG has been frustrating. team thanked mentor for sharing and highlighted that it?s a lot of dynamics happening, and that they are still in the stage of figuring out what their relationship is and what their expectations are, so it makes some sense that they?re working through these things. team said it?s a great thing that PG is plugged in and suggested activities, but team can understand it being frustrating when they cost money that they haven?t discussed spending or are at the same time as something they already have scheduled. team reflected that the main concerns fall into two categories, logistics/communication and budgeting, mentor agreed. team said we?d talk through things a bit today but that ultimately team would talk to family team who would have a bigger conversation with PG because a lot of it comes down to making sure they?re all on the same page with expectations. team noted that child said she doesn?t want to do team activities, but those could be a good option as they?re still figuring everything out since they?re already scheduled and don?t require spending money, mentor agreed and we discussed that sometimes young people don?t like the sound of facilitated activities but when they do them they have a good time. mentor shared that she has tried to coordinate time for her and PG to talk more directly, but PG has ignored mentor?s request for that by responding to other things in their texts but not that. team said it?s great that mentor is really open to strategies and conversation. team suggested that for budgeting/paying for match activities, mentor can thank PG for the amount she did send and share what the remaining cost is as more of a positive approach, mentor said she liked that idea and agreed that being more forthright with conversations around money will be important. team explained that the main next step will be for family team to discuss the topics of budgeting and scheduling and see if we?re able to develop solutions from that, then if needed we can all meet for a group meeting to reset expectations but hopefully we?re able to talk through everything before that. mentor agreed. mentor said she?d try to follow up after their upcoming hang out. team asked if mentor had any further questions or thoughts, mentor said no. team thanked mentor for her time.

Thanks! - Andy (team) mentor mentor BIG (child: child child) Jun 20, 3:21 PM Thanks for the reminder. Z and I are going to the Engineering event tonight at team, my understanding was that counts. Am I wrong on that? Jun 21 You Jun 21, 11:50 AM Ah! Thanks for that! I apologize that I didn't see your registration. I just looked it over and all sounds good to me! Did you two enjoy the event last night? mentor mentor BIG (child: child child) Jun 21, 12:11 PM I think so. She seemed happy at the beginning but ran out of time to finish her project and kind of shut down and got frustrated. But her mom said she was smiling and playing when she got home after and that hasn't happened in a while. So I'll take that as a positive sign! Today You 4:32 PM further questions! team introduced herself and explained the match support team. team asked mentor to bring team up to speed with how things have been going with the match. mentor said over the last week or so it seems they may not want to continue with the program. mentor said they met at the GMI and enjoyed it, got Boba tea for their first outing, then went to a thrift store and enjoyed shopping around and then got a milkshake. mentor said they were planning on going to the Saints game but they both ended up getting sick. mentor said PG had confirmed that they couldn?t go, then mentor texted the following day to ask how they?re doing and didn?t hear back. mentor has since texted 3 additional times looking to schedule something, but hasn?t heard back. BIg said she?s worried child doesn?t want to do it anymore, but they did have fun for the first few outings so she?s not sure what happened. team coached that it has only been a week since mentor heard from PG and it?s very possible that their whole house was sick, or some other explanation. team encouraged mentor to wait about a week to reach out again to give them some time to get back. team said Family team will be reaching out to PG as well and if we hear any updates team will be sure to share. mentor agreed and said that is helpful to hear. mentor said she knows child?s previous match had a ?sensitive ending? so mentor wants to be very mindful of child?s feelings. team said that is awesome. team asked if mentor had any further questions or needs, mentor said no. mentor said team has ?been great? about providing activity ideas, team offered to send the outing checklist as well, mentor said that would be great. team thanked mentor for her time. team asked how things are going lately. mentor said it is ?overall less frustrating? and she feels ?less stuck?. mentor said for October and November they scheduled their dates ahead of time, but not necessarily the activity, but it helped a lot just to get things on the calendar. They also had a conversation about money and agreed on $10 per outing, which can roll over within the month. mentor said PG was ?really clear? that she wouldn?t be able to drive for activities, and it?s helpful to have those parameters. mentor said PG had suggested going to Holidazzle, but mentor wasn?t going ot be able to get child and then to the event on time, so PG brought child and her other child which worked out great. team said that is an awesome example of working within boundaries while also finding opportunities for flexibility, mentor agreed. mentor said they also did pickleball recently which was fun. team said it sounds like things are really moving in the right direction, mentor agreed. Their conversations ?vary? from being more surface level to more ?life things?, and PG gives mentor feedback that child?s mood is always more positive when she gets home which is reassuring to hear. team said that is awesome, and it?s super normal for conversations to vary especially this early on, and to get that positive feedback from PG is really helpful. mentor agreed. mentor said she?s keeping a closer eye on events and they?re hoping to go to the fashion event coming up, team said that?s a great strategy and noted that team events seem to be a hit with them, mentor agreed. team asked if mentor had any further questions or needs, mentor said no. team thanked mentor for her time.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n
